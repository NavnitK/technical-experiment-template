# Why describe one view with multiple UML diagrams?
**1. Different Diagrams Show Different Aspects**  
  - For example, in a Client-Server View:  
    - A Component Diagram shows the static components and interfaces.
    - A Sequence Diagram shows how messages flow during runtime interactions.
    - A Deployment Diagram shows where client and server physically reside.
    - Each diagram highlights a different facet of the same view.

**2. Clarity & Completeness**  
  - One diagram alone canâ€™t capture all the complexities.
  - Combining diagrams provides a fuller, clearer picture of both structure and behavior.

**3. Audience Needs Vary**  
  - Developers might focus on class or component diagrams.
  - Network engineers might need deployment diagrams.
  - QA or analysts might want sequence diagrams for behavior validation.

**4. Reduce Complexity**  
  - Trying to cram all info into one diagram makes it cluttered and hard to understand.
  - Splitting concerns across diagrams keeps each focused and easier to read.

**5. Better Communication**  
  - Multiple views cater to different stakeholder perspectives, improving overall communication.
