Question 1 (25 points)
The screen snapshot below is from an IDE displaying the basic structure of the source code of a software project. Elements with the letter 'C' in a blue circle are classes; elements with the letter 'I' in a green circle are interfaces; the other symbol is a package.
 
Create a UML diagram based on this screen snapshot. Your diagram should represent the structure and should only show the information that is visible in this IDE snapshot. 
You can create the diagram by hand or using any drawing tool.
