# 🧩 Modifiability Quality Attribute Requirement

## Problem Statement  
The Remote User Interface (RUI) should support easy integration of new features and changes (e.g., detection modules, UI components like maps) without major rewrites or regressions. It must be adaptable to evolving requirements and developer environments, specifically within the VCL C++ Builder framework.

## Specific Modifiability Issues to Solve  
- **Adding New Functionalities**  
  Allow plug-and-play integration of features such as aircraft anomaly detection modules into the RUI.  
- **Swapping Components**  
  Make components such as the map provider easily replaceable in the VCL-based RUI without breaking existing functionality.

## Design Objective  
Create a modular system architecture that separates concerns, encourages clean interfaces, and minimizes interdependencies, allowing safe and efficient modifications or extensions to the VCL-based RUI.

## Usability Tactics  
- **Extensible Feature Integration**  
  Design the RUI so new detection modules or features can be added with minimal impact on existing code.  
- **Swappable Components**  
  Architect components such as the map provider to be replaceable within the VCL UI with minimal code changes and risk.

## Quality Attribute Scenario: Extensible Feature Integration

- **Source**  
  Developer  
- **Stimulus**  
  Add anomaly detection feature to the RUI  
- **Artifact**  
  Aircraft data processing and UI display components in the VCL RUI  
- **Environment**  
  During iterative development and maintenance  
- **Response**  
  New detection module integrates with minimal changes and no regressions  
- **Response Measure**  
  Integration completed within a day; no new defects introduced  

### 🛠 Approach 1: Plug-in Architecture (Microkernel)  
- Core RUI separates core processing from optional detection modules via shared interfaces.  
- Each new detection module (e.g., flight path deviation) implements a defined interface.  
- New modules plugged in without changing core logic, enabling modular growth in the VCL environment.

### 🛠 Approach 2: Event-Driven Observer Model  
- Core aircraft tracking logic in the RUI emits events.  
- Detection modules subscribe as observers and react independently.  
- Modules can be added or removed without changing core emitter code.

### ⚖️ Tradeoff Analysis

| Quality Attribute | Plug-in Architecture             | Event-Driven Observer Model          |
|-------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Performance       | Slight overhead for dynamic calls | High; lightweight event dispatching  |
| Resiliency        | High isolation of faulty modules | Dependent on observer error handling  |
| Extensibility     | Very high; supports 3rd-party modules | High; easy add/remove of listeners    |
| Modifiability     | Excellent; isolated changes      | Good; requires event contract management |

### 🧠 Rationale for Approach Selection  
- ✅ **Plug-in Architecture**  
  - Matches modular design suited for VCL C++ Builder.  
  - Clear separation between core and extensions.  
  - **Patterns used:** Microkernel, Strategy  
- ⚠️ **Event-Driven Observer Model**  
  - Lightweight and easy to extend.  
  - **Patterns used:** Observer, Event-Driven  

### 🏁 Final Recommendation  
> ✅ **Plug-in Architecture (Microkernel)** for modular, maintainable feature integration in the VCL RUI.

## Quality Attribute Scenario: Swappable Components

- **Source**  
  Developer  
- **Stimulus**  
  Switch map provider from Mapbox to OpenLayers in the VCL RUI  
- **Artifact**  
  Map rendering module within the VCL-based RUI  
- **Environment**  
  During UI upgrade or enhancement  
- **Response**  
  New map provider integrates with minimal impact on other UI parts  
- **Response Measure**  
  Integration completed under 4 hours; unrelated UI unaffected  

### 🛠 Approach 1: Adapter Pattern with Abstract Map Interface  
- Define an abstract interface (`IMapProvider`) for map operations within the VCL RUI.  
- Each map provider implements this interface.  
- The VCL UI interacts through interface pointers, enabling seamless swapping.

### 🛠 Approach 2: Plugin-Based UI Components  
- Package map providers as dynamically loadable VCL packages (BPL).  
- Load map components at runtime, injecting them into the UI dynamically.  
- Decouples map lifecycle from the core RUI.

### ⚖️ Tradeoff Analysis

| Quality Attribute | Adapter + Interface             | Plugin-based UI Component           |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Performance       | Very high; statically bound calls | Minor runtime overhead             |
| Resiliency        | High; isolated implementation   | Moderate; possible load-time errors |
| Extensibility     | Moderate; requires new implementations | High; supports runtime addition   |
| Modifiability     | Easy; confined to adapter classes | More complex; requires runtime management |

### 🧠 Rationale for Approach Selection  
- ✅ **Adapter Pattern with Interface Abstraction**  
  - Fits VCL’s static typing and component model.  
  - Easier debugging and maintenance.  
  - **Patterns used:** Adapter, Interface Segregation  
- ⚠️ **Plugin-based Component**  
  - Useful for runtime flexibility.  
  - More complex lifecycle handling.  
  - **Patterns used:** Factory, Plugin  

### 🏁 Final Recommendation  
> ✅ **Adapter Pattern with Interface Abstraction** for stable, maintainable map provider swapping in the VCL RUI.
