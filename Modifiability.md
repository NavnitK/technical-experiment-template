# 🧩 Modifiability Quality Attribute Requirement

## Problem Statement  
The system should allow developers to integrate a new map provider into the user interface with minimal code changes, low risk of introducing bugs, and without affecting unrelated parts of the system.

## Specific Modifiability Issue to Solve  
- **Supporting Additional Map Providers**  
  Enable integration of new map rendering services without disrupting existing UI components.

## Design Objective  
Design the Remote User Interface (RUI) to have loosely coupled components with well-defined interfaces to isolate changes and make new map providers easy to incorporate.

## Usability Tactics  
- **Isolate Map Service**  
  Encapsulate all map-related functionality behind an abstract interface.  
- **Dependency Injection**  
  Use runtime injection to provide the specific map provider to the UI, allowing easy integration of new services.

## Quality Attribute Scenario: Add Support for New Map Provider

- **Source**  
  Developer  
- **Stimulus**  
  Add a new map provider to the system  
- **Artifact**  
  Map rendering module in the Remote User Interface (RUI)  
- **Environment**  
  During iterative development or feature expansion  
- **Response**  
  The new map provider integrates seamlessly without affecting existing components  
- **Response Measure**  
  Integration completed in under 4 hours; no unintended side effects observed  

### 🛠 Approach 1: Abstract Common Services with Map Interface  
- Define a common abstract interface for map services that all map providers implement.  
- The RUI interacts only with this interface, allowing developers to add new providers without modifying core UI logic.  
- This reduces coupling between the UI and specific providers while improving cohesion within map modules.

### 🛠 Approach 2: Modularize Map Component with Dependency Injection  
- Encapsulate map logic into a standalone module injected at runtime into the RUI.  
- New providers are integrated by injecting a module that adheres to the map interface.  
- This defers binding decisions to runtime, enabling flexibility and clean separation of concerns.

### ⚖️ Tradeoff Analysis

| Quality Attribute | Abstract Map Interface                | Dependency Injection Module          |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Performance       | Very high; static binding              | Slight overhead due to runtime binding |
| Resiliency        | High; isolated map component           | High; modular and replaceable         |
| Extensibility     | Moderate; requires interface updates   | High; new modules can be added easily |
| Modifiability     | Easy; confined to map interface        | Very easy; no UI changes required     |

### 🧠 Rationale for Approach Selection  
- ✅ **Abstract Common Services with Map Interface**  
  - Provides compile-time safety and clarity.  
  - Ideal when new map providers are added occasionally.  
  - Promotes high cohesion within mapping logic and minimizes dependencies.  
- ⚠️ **Modularize Map Component with Dependency Injection**  
  - Suitable when map providers need to be added or replaced frequently.  
  - Increases flexibility through runtime configuration.  
  - Keeps UI logic unchanged, improving long-term maintainability.

### 🏁 Final Recommendation  
> ✅ **Abstract Common Services with Map Interface** to enable structured, low-risk integration of new map providers without disrupting existing UI behavior.
